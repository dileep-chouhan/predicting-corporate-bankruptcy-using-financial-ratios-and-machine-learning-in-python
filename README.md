# Predicting Corporate Bankruptcy using Financial Ratios and Machine Learning in Python

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying financially distressed companies.  Using publicly available financial statement data and machine learning techniques implemented in Python, we analyze key financial ratios to build a model capable of predicting the likelihood of corporate bankruptcy. This allows stakeholders to minimize investment risk by identifying potentially problematic companies early on.  The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add other libraries used here if needed)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC).  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing the distribution of key financial ratios, model performance curves) in the `output` directory.  These files will provide a visual representation of the data and the model's predictive capabilities.  Specific file names might vary depending on the analysis performed.
